# RunNGunVR

RunNGunVR is a Virtual Reality prototype built in the Unity game engine. The goal of this project was to explore the current state of XR development that Unity was capable of at the time, and create an immersive sci-fi shooter using it's tools.

Areas of focus for this project:
- Building familiarity with the packages and plug-ins that Unity has available for VR development.
- Creating a holster system for the weapons that the player can use, smaller weapons on the hips and large on the back, with magazines spawning on the players chest.
- Improving immersion by taking enemy characters a step beyond basic animation and integrating "Active" ragdolls, so that they can have realistic hit reactions and then fully ragdoll on death.
- Investigating optimization challenges that arise from VR development and building for wireless VR hardware like the Meta Quest 2. Using strategies like object pooling for enemy characters and projectiles to improve performance.
